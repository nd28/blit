          I am very much bothered by my poor skill to remember things as
          precisely as image. I don’t have a good memory. It is so much worse. I
          don’t really remember the examples to write here.
        </p>

        <p>
          But I do remember things by the feel like I feel that my memory is
          really worse. So anytime I am trying to right something and I couldn’t
          remember the proper words or the artefacts of the story. It is very
          frustrating for me.
        </p>

        <p>
          I watched the movie Altered Carbon: resleeved (I have to look up the
          name). And I thought we already have the internet and it is already
          deeply rooted to fulfil our daily needs.

          Like in order to purchase the home appliances or important bills to
          pay. You would use the form of digital payment because going to the
          store and paperwork then taking to home in delivery truck and It is
          hassle and you have to be really focused from the start to the end
          (choosing the fridge til it arrived in ur house) whilst in one click
          and some OTP verification you have avoided all the hassle. Same for
          bill payment like you wouldn’t have to go to the officer to submit
          your payment in cash with your bills and if everyone is paying bill
          physically then the long queue. You can avoid all that with internet.
        </p>

        <p>
          Another one is the movies and shows, No need to go to theatre when u
          only got couple of hours to chill. Another one is very biased to me. I
          can learn when I feel like I am focused. I don’t need to force myself
          to learn some new skills on afternoon 13:00 to 16:00 with all other
          peers. And listen to someone explaining without any opportunities to
          brainstorm the doubts.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am also very easily distracted. By distraction I gain my full focus
          back. My change is the disorganisation that it brings to my life. What
          was I thinking an hour ago? What did I spend my time yesterday? Why do
          I feel like I was supposed to do something important today? why am I
          feeling blank ATM? What are my backlogs (things I put up for later in
          free time)? Can I rest today or do I have something to do which I
          don’t remember?
        </p>

        <p>
          Does it sound familiar? If not then I am really ill mentally and it
          seems to be my issue only.
        </p>
        <p>
          Well anyhow I need to find the solution..whether it’s my sole concern
          or everyones.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is experimentation that because the internet is so deeply rooted
          in our life. Internet is the solution to keep us/me organised.
        </p>

        <p>
          Well in case it is generic problem then the solution needs to be
          personalised and extremely customisable. Because if this is gonna be
          my highest screen time app then I wouldn’t get along with anything
          non-aesthetic. I would really want it match my style or it will feel
          really foreign to me (not for those who is never bothered of light
          mode at night). Designing it would be the hardest challenge cause I
          don’t know what is the head and what is the tail (means that I can’t
          just my decision, right or wrong)
